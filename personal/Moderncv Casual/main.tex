I would like to apply for a position as a demonstrator for either first or second year computer science students with the university. I have already worked as a demonstrator for the university during the second year of my undergraduate and now that I have finished my industrial placement would be eager to volunteer again.

I am keen to join the demonstrating team again for a number of reasons. Firstly, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience the first time round. I like interacting with the new and upcoming undergraduate students and enjoyed helping them with concepts that I found myself found difficult. 

Secondly, I am currently pursuing postgraduate study options which could potentially include more exposure to teaching and assisting in practicals. The experience of demonstrating provides an opportunity to get some first hand practice before reaching this point in my career path.

Thirdly, demonstrating helps me to maintain my knowledge of subjects that I would not of necessarily revisited from becoming rusty. For example, none of the later modules in my course require an understanding of Haskell, but the requirement to be adequately prepared to answer questions on the subject in demonstrating sessions encourages to me refresh myself on a regular basis.

As requested I have attached below a copy of my grades for each of the modules I have completed  at Aberystwyth during my undergraduate.
