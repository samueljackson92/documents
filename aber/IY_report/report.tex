	\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This report details the industrial placement undertaken by the me as
part of the year in industry required for qualification of the Software
Engineering MEng qualification. The position of the placement was a
junior role as part of the Mantid data analysis framework development
team based at the ISIS facility at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in
Harwell, Oxfordshire, owned by the Science and Technologies Facilities
Council (STFC) for the duration of a one year contract of employment.
This position was then extended by an additional two months to continue
with existing and new project commitments.

ISIS is a world leading neutron and muon scattering facility. The
facility operates a 800 MeV proton synchrotron which acts as a source of
neutrons for spectroscopy {[}1{]}. Neutron spectroscopy can be used to
probe the structure and dynamics of materials at a truly fundamental
level.

The Mantid project aims to provide a single, unified application for the
analysis of neutron and muon scattering facilities such as ISIS {[}2{]}.
The project is primarily developed by two teams of developers, one based
at ISIS and one at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oakridge
laboratory in Tennessee, USA. While the author primarily worked within
the development team based at ISIS, developers are generally also
attached to a specific scientific group within the facility. In the
author's case this was the ISIS Molecular Spectroscopy group (MSG) which
specializes in indirect inelastic and quasielastic neutron scattering
for condensed matter science {[}3{]} and thus much of the work done was
carried out in relation to the needs and requirements of the MSG.

\section{Organisational Environment}\label{organisational-environment}

\subsection{Organisation of STFC}\label{organisation-of-stfc}

The Science and Technologies Facilities Council is a UK government
funded body that carries out a wide variety of scientific research
across a multitude of disciplines including particle physics, nuclear
physics, space science and engineering, medical and biological sciences,
and computational science.

While the organisation is funded by the government, it is classified as
a non-governmental body which acts as an umbrella organisation for an
array of facilities based across the UK. These include (but are not
limited to) the central laser facility, diamond light source, ISIS
neutron source and RAL space based at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in
Oxfordshire, the Daresbury Laboratory located in Cheshire and the
Chilbolton Observatory based in Hampshire.

The organisation has its head office located at Polaris House, Swindon,
Wiltshire and is headed by the Chief Executive John Womersley. The
purpose of STFC is to control the general overall management of the
facilities under its control, in particular it is responsible for
allocating budgetary and staffing allowances and liaising between
government departments, particularly the department for business,
innovation and skills.

\subsection{Organisation of ISIS Neutron
Source}\label{organisation-of-isis-neutron-source}

ISIS Neutron source is a project that is owned, operated and funded by
the STFC. The organisational hierarchy of ISIS is headed by the director
Prof.~Robert McGreevy and several division heads for individual
functional areas within ISIS such as the diffraction, spectroscopy and
support, experimental operations, instrumentation, design, and
accelerator divisions.

ISIS is also split into a number of research, operations, and
experimental support groups. The computing group, of which the Mantid
project is a part of, falls into the experimental support group and is
technically a part of the scientific computing group which also includes
the ICAT data catalogue which manages the data collected from sample
runs on the instruments for future analysis.

While this description provides an overview of how the staffing of ISIS
can be divided, in practice there tends to be a lot of cross over
between sections of the organisation depending on a employees skills and
responsibilities. For example, while I was employed as part of the
scientific computing group, my line manager and senior manager were both
members of the molecular spectroscopy research group whose interests I
was responsible for within Mantid.

\subsection{Organisation of the Mantid Project Development
Team}\label{organisation-of-the-mantid-project-development-team}

The Mantid development project is a subset of the scientific computing
group. The Mantid group is headed by a single project manager (Nick
Draper) who is based at ISIS where the project first started and is
resposible for the overall management and direction of the project. The
project is split into two teams, one based at ISIS and one at the SNS in
Oakridge, Tennessee. Both teams consist of a single lead developer and
several senior developers who oversee the major technical developments
and help to guide and manage the rest of the development team. Within
Mantid, the project manager and the majority of the senior developers
are actually contractors from Tessella Ltd, based in Abingdon,
Oxfordshire. The rest of the development team are directly employed by
ISIS and STFC.

\subsection{A Brief Introduction to Neutron
Scattering}\label{a-brief-introduction-to-neutron-scattering}

We are aware that the reader is unlikely to be familiar with the basic
principles of neutron scattering experiments. Subsequently it is
difficult to describe the organisation of the technical aspects of the
project without some prior background knowledge of the subject. Here we
aim to provide the reader with an extremely brief overview of very
fundamentals of neutron scattering with particular attention to indirect
inelastic spectroscopy. For a more detailed discussion the principals
presented here we recommend the excellent primer by Robert Pynn {[}4{]}.
