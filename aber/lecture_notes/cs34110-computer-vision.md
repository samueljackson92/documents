### Topics in Computer Vision

 - Paradigms
    - understanding that images can have different meanings
 - Image formation
    - Minimise and mitigate the errors and noise introduced during the image capturing process
 - Edge/Feature detection
    - Edges: pixels in which there is a distinct change
        - Finding discontinuations of the colour content of the image
    - Features: Corners and corner-like pixels in an image
 - Object Recognition
    - Reconstruction of more complex objects from an image using features and edges.
 - Motion
    - Optical flow. Three dimensional; how features in a 2D image change and evolve as time progresses
 - Shape from *x*
    - Shapes from shading, textures, structure in an image etc.
 - 3D Vision
