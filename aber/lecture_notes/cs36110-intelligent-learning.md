# CS36110: Intelligent Learning

## 2014-10-01

### Course examination

 - 2 hour written examination
 - Must answer 3 out of 4 questions

### Module Looks At

 - Tackling complex problems in the real world
    - Learning in humans is subconscious
    - We wish to make it explicit

### Topics

 - Introduction
 - Concept Learning
 - Decision Tree Learning
 - Artificial Neural Networks
 - Bayesian Learning
 - Support Vector Machines
 - Reinforcement Learning

### Introduction

 - Three core questions
    - Why develop intelligent learning?
    - How to define a learning problem?
    - How to measure the performance of an algorithm?

 - Experience is the key
     - Experience is an input-output pair
        - Input: environment in which you wish to solve problems
        - Output: the decision you wish to make.
     - We learn from experience
        - Experience gives us insight
     - Experience is input, knowledge is output

### When To Use Intelligent Learning

 - Human expertise doesn't exist
    - e.g. Mars rover
 - Humans are unable to easily explain their expertise
    - e.g. knowledge of the english language.
 - The solution changes over time
    - e.g. routing through a computer network
 - The solution needs to be adapted for specific cases
     - e.g. medical diagnosis, user biometrics

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Intelligent Learning

  - Advantages
     - often more accurate than human rules
        - Data driven
     - Humans are incapable of expressing what they know
         - e.g. English language
         - Can easily classify what they know
     - Automatic method to search for hypotheses given data
     - Cheap and flexible
        - Can apply to any learning task

 - Disadvantages
     - Need lots of labelled data in order for the program to learn
     - Very error prone
         - Impossible to get perfect accuracy
     - Often difficult to discern what has actually been learned
         - Many this may be learned from a single dataset
