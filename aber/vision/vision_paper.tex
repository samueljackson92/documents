% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
This paper examines the Viola-Jones face detection algorithm \cite{viola2004robust} to the application of counting people in the real world. The Viola-Jones algorithm presented in \cite{viola2004robust} proposes an efficient method of performing face detection at frame rate with reasonably accurate results.

Detecting faces is a major challenge in the field of computer vision, and one which has many practical applications. Accurately determining whether a scene or photograph contains a face is provides many challenges. Yang et al. \cite{yang2002detecting} lists a number of different factors affecting human face detection. Faces typically have a wide degree of variation. They have different prominent facial features, skin colour, scars, facial hair, and hair styles. The pose also causes issues. The side of a face is very different from the frontal view. Occlusions prove another major obstacle. In a crowded scene it is easy for a face to be partially or wholly excluded, glasses and sun glasses are also a common source of occlusions. The quality of the capture including the lighting, focus, and contrast can affect the image quality. The characteristics of the camera such as the lenses and sensors also affect final capture.

Another major factor which increases the difficulty of face detection is the complexity of the problem. Photographs and video generally have an incredibly large feature space to search making looking for the face at every pixel and scale an impossibly complex task to practically accomplish at frame rate.

Despite these obstacles efficient detection of faces in a scene continues to be desirable for a multitude of practical applications. One of the most common uses of a face detection system is as part of a larger system, such as a face recognition or image analysis. In order to correctly recognise a face it must first be found. In this way face detection algorithms act as a preprocessor to a larger system. Other applications include uses in image databases, social media, and video conferencing. Automatic detection of faces can be used in image management system to find faces in images as part of a precursor to automatically annotating images with meta data. The most obvious example would be the image tagging feature on sites such as Facebook. Applications to video conferencing include the need to adjust the focus of the camera relative to the speak. 

The approach taken by Viola-Jones in \cite{viola2004robust}, is also not restricted to detecting faces. A cascade classifier such as the one presented in \cite{viola2004robust} can be trained to detect a variety of objects other objects provided that sufficient positive and negative examples can be supplied for training. For example, work based on the Viola-Jones detection algorithm has been used to detect people \cite{viola2003detecting}, license plates \cite{zhang2006learning}, and facial features (eyes, nose, and mouth) \cite{wilson2006facial}.

The major contribution that the Viola-Jones algorithm makes is in the speed at which the algorithm can detect a face. Many approaches prior to Viola-Jones could offer reasonably good detection rates \cite{sung1998example} \cite{schneiderman2000statistical} \cite{rowley1998neural}, but the Viola-Jones algorithm's strength is in the speed ups offered by their method.

Viola-Jones solves the problem of rapid object detection through the use of three key components. The First component is that the Haar features used to detect faces are computed using an integral image representation. This representation allows for rapid evaluation of Haar features in constant time. The second component is to use the AdaBoost algorithm to choose a small number of features that classify the training set well. The third component is to combine the weak classifiers into a cascade of classifier, with the least complex classifiers at the beginning of the cascade. This ensures that the majority of negative examples are rejected early using classifiers that are quick to evaluate, but that later, more complex nodes in the classifier minimise the occurrence of false positives. Once the cascade of classifiers has been trained it is very efficient to classify new examples by running the image through the cascade.

The rest of this paper is dedicated to reviewing the performance of Viola-Jones object detection in various circumstances and discussing its application to the titular problem. Section \ref{sec:critique-of-method} reviews the what problems Viola-Jones can be used to solve and what it cannot solve. Section \ref{sec:application-of-method} discusses how the technique could be applied to the titular problem and what issues the like issues encountered would be. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} rounds off the the paper with conclusions drawn from the preceding sections. Finally, section \ref{sec:self-evaluation} provides my self evaluation of this paper.

\section{Critique of Method} \label{sec:critique-of-method}
Viola-Jones object detection represents a major breakthrough in the computer vision community by bringing practical speed ups in face detection through intelligent data structures and clever use of the AdaBoost algorithm to make face detection in real time a possibility. However, success of the technique is not without its limitations and the technique has several possible failure modes.

At the time of publication of the technique had results that had ``detection and false positive rates which [were] equivalent to the best published results'' \cite{viola2004robust} but executed in in a much smaller amount of time. Comparisons between the major approaches published at the time are given at the end of the paper, but the results are not entirely definitive due to most approaches not providing a full receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for their classifiers or did not publish there best results. In the case of Sung and Poggio \cite{sung1998example} only the MIT part of the common dataset was used (as the CMU dataset did not yet exist). In spite of this, the authors show that their technique provides roughly equivalent levels of performance given the available data. The authors note that the best performance was achieved using a voting regime between three classifiers trained with different negative examples, different negative vs. positive errors, and different criteria for also positives vs. classifier size.

Unfortunately the Viola-Jones has quite a few failure modes in which it will give a high number of either false positives or false negatives. One of the biggest drawbacks of the vanilla implementation presented in the paper is that it can only detect frontal images of faces. Faces viewed for the side or in a different rotation or orientation are unlikely to be correctly detected. The technique can be used to correct detect faces as viewed from the side profile by training a different classifier with sufficient positive and negative examples. Both sides of the face could be accounted for by training a classifier for one side of the face, testing the image then flipping the image and running the classifier again to account for the other side. Similar problems occur when the classifier is presented with faces that are rotated, either in or out of the image plane. Jones and Viola \cite{jones2003fast} attempted to alleviate these issues by training multiple classifiers for each of the poses and using additional diagonal Haar like features. The choice of classifier used is decided using a decision tree. This gives a two step approach to classification in which the first step estimates the pose and the second runs selected pose classifier.

Further work by Lienhart et al. \cite{lienhart2002extended} provides empirical evidence that better results can be obtained from the Viola-Jones approach though the use of a number of extensions such using the gentle AdaBoost algorithm in favour of the original discrete AdaBoost implementation. They also performed experiments with a broader set of Haar features which were formed from rotated versions of the original features. These appeared to produce more accurate results despite complicating the learning procedure by successfully encoding more domain knowledge into the learning procedure that it would otherwise have difficulty learning.

More recent work published by Brubaker et al. \cite{brubaker2008design} achieved improved the speed of the detector as well as reducing the training time without sacrificing accuracy.


\section{Application of Method} \label{sec:application-of-method}

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
