\section{\sc Profile}
I am a fourth year undergraduate software engineering student at Aberystwyth university. I have already completed two years of my undergraduate with an average of a first. I have also recently finished an industrial placement year as a software engineering at the Science and Technology Facilities Council. In this role worked on a large scale data analysis application for neutron scattering instruments, primarily written in C++ and Python. I am now six months into the fourth year of my degree and have just started working on my dissertation project involving mammogram image analysis.

\section{\sc Professional Experience}
{\bf Software Developer, STFC, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory}, Harwell, Oxfordshire, UK

\vspace{-.3cm}
{\em Year in Industry} \hfill {\bf July, 2013 - August, 2014}\\
I have recently been employed as a software developer for ISIS Neutron source based at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Harwell, Oxfordshire to develop the Mantid neutron and muon data analysis application. This project was primarily written in C++ and Python. I was primarily responsible for the development of the framework for indirect geometry instruments, but also helped develop the general framework during my time with the project. I was involved with every step of the development process from requirements gathering to design, through to implementation, testing, and maintenance. My original contract was extended so I could continue working through the summer before university began.
