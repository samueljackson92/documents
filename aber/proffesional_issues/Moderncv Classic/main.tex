I am responding to the advertisement for a graduate Java developer position in your start-up company. Please find attached a copy of my resume for your consideration.

I am a final year student at Aberystwyth University who has a wide range of skills you are looking for in your advertised position. My degree has furnished me with a wide variety of technical knowledge, a high level of self-motivation, and the initiative to adapt to new and unfamiliar environments. 

My year in industry has given me the teamwork and communication skills that are essential in the modern software development industry though close customer contact and working in a tight nit yet diverse development team.

I have a wealth of experience in Java and object orientated programming gained from my degree and my work experience respectively. During my degree I have developed numerous applications, including web based Java applications and RESTful client software. I am more than proficient in my knowledge of MySQL databases and I have a good working knowledge of Linux environments and Apache web servers.

I thank you for your time in considering my application and I hope to hear from you soon.
